# WebStorm TypeScript Namespace Import Plugin - Development Plan

## Project Goal
Create a WebStorm plugin that helps with autocompleting namespace imports in TypeScript. When the user types "mapU", the plugin should suggest `import * as mapUtil from 'common/map_util';` as an autocomplete option.

## Requirements
- Handle multiple TypeScript projects with their own tsconfig.json files
- Respect `compilerOptions.paths`, `baseUrl`, and `outDir` settings
- Ignore node_modules/ and output directories
- Support intelligent prefix matching for namespace imports

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Plugin Foundation ‚è≥
**Step 1: Hello World Completion** ‚úÖ
- [x] Create a basic `CompletionContributor` that triggers when user types "asdf"
- [x] Simply adds "!" at the end ‚Üí "asdf!"
- [x] Learn the IntelliJ completion API basics

**Step 2: Expand Basic Completion** ‚ùå (Won't do)
- [x] ~~Make it work with any 4-letter prefix (not just "asdf")~~ - Skipping to focus on core functionality
- [x] ~~Add multiple completion options~~ - Skipping to focus on core functionality  
- [x] ~~Learn about completion contexts and filtering~~ - Skipping to focus on core functionality

### Phase 2: TypeScript File Discovery
**Step 3: File System Scanning** ‚úÖ
- [x] Scan project for all `.ts` and `.tsx` files
- [x] Store file paths in a simple list/map
- [x] Ignore basic patterns like `node_modules/` for now

**Step 4: Extract Module Names** ‚úÖ
- [x] Parse file paths to generate potential import names
- [x] Example: `src/common/map_util.ts` ‚Üí suggest "mapUtil" prefix
- [x] Store mapping of prefix ‚Üí file path

### Phase 3: Basic Import Suggestions
**Step 5: Simple Import Completion** ‚úÖ
- [x] When user types "mapU", suggest `import * as mapUtil from './path/to/file'`
- [x] Use relative paths for now (no tsconfig.json parsing yet)
- [x] Test with a few hardcoded examples

### Phase 4: TypeScript Project Integration ‚úÖ
**Step 6: Find tsconfig.json Files** ‚úÖ
- [x] Locate all `tsconfig.json` files in the project
- [x] Parse basic properties: `baseUrl`, `paths`, `outDir`, `rootDir`
- [x] Handle multiple TypeScript projects in one workspace

**Step 7: Path Resolution** ‚úÖ
- [x] Use `baseUrl` and `paths` mapping to generate correct import paths
- [x] Convert file system paths to TypeScript module paths
- [x] Example: `src/common/map_util.ts` + baseUrl ‚Üí `common/map_util`
- [x] Handle `rootDir` configuration for proper module resolution
- [x] Prioritize path mappings over baseUrl resolution

### Phase 5: Smart Filtering & Performance
**Step 8: Advanced Filtering** ‚è≥
- [x] Exclude `node_modules/`, `outDir`, and other irrelevant paths
- [ ] Respect `.gitignore` patterns
- [ ] Add configuration options for custom exclusions

**Step 9: Performance & Caching**
- [x] Cache file scans and tsconfig parsing (services cache in init blocks)
- [ ] Move scanning from lazy service initialization to project startup
- [ ] Add file system watchers for incremental updates when files change
- [ ] Debounce file system watchers to avoid excessive re-scanning
- [ ] Background indexing to avoid blocking UI during initial scan
- [ ] Optimize completion performance (currently just reads from pre-built cache)

### Phase 6: Polish & Edge Cases
**Step 10: Enhanced Matching**
- [ ] Improve prefix matching (camelCase, snake_case, kebab-case)
- [ ] Handle nested directories intelligently
- [ ] Add fuzzy matching capabilities

**Step 11: UI/UX Improvements**
- [ ] Better completion item presentation
- [ ] Icons and styling
- [ ] Configuration panel in IDE settings

## Current Status
‚úÖ **Completed**: Step 7 - Path Resolution (including Steps 6-7)  
‚è≥ **In Progress**: Step 9 - Performance & Caching (basic caching ‚úÖ, need startup optimization)  
üéØ **Next Priority**: Move file scanning from lazy initialization to project startup

## Notes
- Starting with simple "asdf!" completion to learn IntelliJ Platform plugin development
- Each step builds incrementally on the previous one
- Focus on getting basic functionality working before adding complex TypeScript parsing logic

## Architecture Decisions
- TBD as we progress through implementation

## Testing Strategy
- TBD as we progress through implementation
